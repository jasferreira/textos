JBS S. A. (JBS) is a meat processor headquartered in Brazil.
Over 90% of its reported emissions are from farms and
feedlots for rearing cattle. The company plans to continue
growth in a GHG emission-intensive industry; we did not find
evidence of any planned deep decarbonisation measures.
JBS does not have an emission reduction target alongside
its net-zero emission target for 2040. Its interim targets for
2030 would lead to a 3% emission reduction compared to its
reported 2021 emissions.
Key developments over the past year: We could identify
only minor changes to JBS’s sustainability strategy since our
previous analysis of the case study in the 2022 Corporate Climate
Responsibility Monitor (Day et al., 2022). Most notably, JBS has
increased its share of reported scope 3 emissions, although
key emission sources are still excluded. Otherwise, only minor
modifications were made to this case study.
JBS does not specify what share of its 2040 net-zero target
will be based on emission reductions and what share will rely
on offsetting. In its communication on its net-zero target, JBS
says that it wants to reduce direct and indirect GHG emissions,
while offsetting residual emissions (JBS, 2022, pp. 7, 63). We
could not identify an emission reduction target accompanying
its net-zero headline pledge. It is therefore unclear what share
of JBS’s emissions footprint will be offset by 2040. Given
the limited detail on emission reduction measures and the
expected continuous growth of the company, this share could
be significant. JBS does not specify any details regarding what
kind of offsetting projects it will procure credits from, the
potential volume of credits it envisages needing, nor general
criteria for ensuring robust environmental integrity in any
offsetting claims it may make.
JBS’s formulation of its interim emission intensity target
for scope 1 and 2 is not transparent, and the target is highly
insufficient, omitting the company’s main emission sources.
JBS says it wants to reduce scope 1 and 2 emissions intensity by
at least 30% by 2030 compared to 2019 (JBS, 2021, p. 11), but is
presented as an absolute target in its most recent sustainability
report (JBS, 2022, p. 16). This inconsistency undermines the
transparency of the target. Moreover, since its reported scope
3 emissions accounted for over 90% of its total emissions
footprint in 2021 (JBS, 2022, p. 19), the target is also highly
insufficient. We did not identify substantial emission reduction
targets for JBS’s most important emission sources in scope 3,
which are primarily related to cattle rearing, including emissions
from enteric fermentation, feed and manure.
We could not find significant details on how JBS intends
to achieve its 2030 emission intensity target and 2040
net-zero target. Rather, JBS plans to continue growth in
a GHG emission-intensive industry. We did not identify a
comprehensive emission reduction strategy: the company
provides minimal detail on how it wants to realise its targets.
We did not find evidence that JBS intends to substantially
innovate or diversify from its current activities. Without major
innovations to drastically reduce the emissions footprint of
meat production or diversifying away from this highly GHG
emissions intensive industry, it is not credible for livestock
agribusinesses to claim that they are on a path to deep
decarbonisation. JBS describes it is in the process of developing
an emission reduction strategy, but this is not expected before
late 2023 (JBS, 2022, p. 10).
JBS aims for 60% renewable electricity in its facilities by
2030 and 100% by 2040 but provides little information
about current and planned renewable energy supply
constructs. The company claims that renewable electricity
accounted for a major share of its consumption in 2021 (43%)
(JBS, 2022, p. 68). JBS has some renewable energy generation
on-site, using solar systems and residue biogas (JBS, 2022, p.
67). The company aims for 60% renewable energy by 2030
and 100% by 2040 (JBS, 2022, p. 16). To achieve this, on-site
generation and high-quality energy procurement structures
are necessary. However, the company does not specify what
procurement constructs it currently uses and what it plans to
use. It remains unclear whether these targets are credible.
JBS includes a larger share of emissions in its disclosure, but
the data is still not presented transparently, and land-use
changes related to rearing cattle are excluded. In its 2022
sustainability report, JBS included more emission sources in its
emissions reporting, compared to its 2021 sustainability report
(JBS, 2021, p. 43, 2022, pp. 64–65). JBS says that key emission
sources including enteric fermentation, feed and manure
management are included in its reported scope 3 emissions, but
the company does not provide a breakdown of the emissions
to these sources (JBS, 2022, pp. 64–65). Moreover, land-use
change emissions related to rearing cattle are not covered
for its emissions reporting for Brazil (JBS, 2022, p. 65). With
the current level of detail, JBS’s emissions disclosure does not
allow for a thorough understanding of the emission sources and
effectiveness of potential mitigation measures.
With its Fund for the Amazon programme, JBS will contribute
to local sustainable development without claiming
neutralisation, but these contributions are significantly
lower than is required to be in proportion to the company’s
climate footprint, equating to only 0.01% of JBS’ annual
revenue. With projects such as ‘RestaurAmazônia’ and
‘Release Credit for Forest Bioeconomy’, JBS wants to support
projects related to sustainable development in the Amazon
biome (Fund for the Amazon, 2022b, 2022c). These projects
are framed as contributions; we did not find evidence that
JBS intends to claim neutralisation of emissions based on the
projects’ outcome. However, JBS will contribute a maximum
USD 93 million to the fund up to 2030 (Fund for the Amazon,
2022a), equal to roughly 0.01% of its revenue. The volume of
this financial contribution is equivalent to a carbon price on
the company’s emissions footprint of approximately just 0.13
USD per tonne CO2e. This is substantially lower than the range
of emerging carbon price recommendations for meaningful
climate contributions, that equate to at least 80 USD per tonne
of CO2e (see section 4.2 of the Methodology).
ntegrity assessment for short- and
medium-term target(s) towards 2030
What do the short- and medium-term targets actually mean?
What are the targets for the short to medium term?
JBS has a target to reduce its scope 1 and 2 emission intensity by 30% by 2030 from a 2019 baseline.
How do these targets equate to emission reductions across the value chain (compared to a 2019 baseline)?
We cannot quantify JBS’s intensity target in terms of absolute emission reductions below 2019 levels due to a lack of publicly
available information.
Do these targets cover both the short term (within 5 years) and medium term (up to 2030)?
JBS does not commit to earlier interim targets within a five-year time horizon.
Do these emission reduction commitments align with a 1.5°C trajectory for the sector according to available literature?
JBS’s 2030 targets are not aligned with any of the few 1.5°C Paris Agreement-aligned milestones for the livestock sector
available in the literature.
Agricultural emissions, including those from enteric fermentation and manure management, need to reduce significantly before
2030 (Boehm et al., 2022, p. 120). Teske (2022, p. 328) identifies 1.5°C-aligned absolute emission reduction milestones for various
emission sources of agricultural activities. Emissions from fuel use on farms, heat used for food processing and -packaging need to
reduce by 48%, emissions from purchased electricity on a farm-level or used for food processing and -packaging need to reduce
67%, and emissions AFOLU, non-CO2 GHGs need to reduce by 34% by 2030. In sum, these required reductions mean a reduction
of 38% across all scopes, below 2019 levels. We did not identify any information indicating that JBS’s emission intensity target
aligns with the latter.
We did not identify any targets for a reduction of scope 3 emissions in the short- and medium-term in JBS’ public communications.
Integrity assessment for long-term
target(s) (post-2030)
What do the long-term targets actually mean?
What are the targets for the long term beyond 2030?
JBS pledges to have net-zero emissions by 2040.
How do these targets equate to emission reductions across the value chain (compared to a 2019 baseline)?
JBS does not commit to a deep emissions reduction target alongside its 2040 net-zero pledge. The company only makes a vague
statement that it intends to offset residual emissions in the target year to achieve the target. Since the company’s net-zero pledge
does not entail any commitment to deep decarbonisation (i.e., reduction of at least 90% of 2019 emissions across the entire value
chain), we consider that the terminology of this target may be misleading. This position is in line with the ISO Net Zero Guidelines
and the SBTi Net Zero Standard (SBTi, 2021c; ISO, 2022b). Net-zero targets can give consumers and investors the impression
that the company aims to reach deep levels of emission reductions, which JBS does not commit to.
Is this emission reduction commitment in line with 1.5°C-compatible trajectories or benchmarks for the sector?
We consider the lack of any post-2030 emission reduction target alongside JBS’s net-zero pledge as highly insufficient
considering the need for deep and credible emission reductions towards mid-century to stand a reasonable chance of limiting
global warming to 1.5°C (IPCC, 2022).
Further assumptions for aggregate analysis in Section A
For our aggregate analysis across all 24 companies in Section A of this report, we make the simplified most optimistic assumption
that companies’ intensity targets equal absolute emission reduction targets. For this purpose, we interpret JBS’s intensity
target (50% by 2030 below 2019 levels for scope 1 and 2) to be an absolute target assuming constant activity levels. Under this
assumption, the target translates to a 3% reduction by 2030 below 2019 levels across the entire value chain. We do not use this
estimate for the company-specific integrity assessment of JBS in Section B.

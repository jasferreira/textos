      WHY IS METHANE A PROBLEM? 

             Methane (CH ) is a powerful but short-lived climate pollutant. Depending 4 
             on which study you reference, methane accounts for between a quarterix   

                         x 
Mand half  of the net rise in global average temperature since the pre- 
industrial era.  

Over a twenty year period, methane emissions have a global warming impact that is 80 times  

                                                                  xi 
worse than an equivalent amount of CO  emissions.   However, unlike CO , methane breaks down 2 2 

                                                                               xii 
in the atmosphere, reducing to half its level in around 11 years   – see Figure 1.

    EA (2017), Fugitive Methane and the Role of Atmospheric Half-Life. Geoinfor Geostat: An Overview 5:3).xiii 

Because of this, taking positive action now to reduce methane emissions has an amplified  

impact. UNEP’s Global Methane Assessment estimates that reducing human-caused methane  

emissions by as much as 45 per cent by 2030 would avoid nearly 0.3°C of global warming by  

the 2040s and complement all long-term climate change mitigation efforts. It would also prevent  

on an annual basis ‘255 000 premature deaths, 775 000 asthma related hospital visits, 73 billion  
hours of lost labour from extreme heat, and 26 million tonnes of crop losses globally’.xiv 

Measures to slow the rate of global warming and related roadmaps tend to focus on two key  

timeframes: between the present day and 2030 and between 2030 and 2050. In the context of  
a twenty-year time horizon, methane emissions reductions are particularly important given the  

speed with which they would be effective.

  Methane is emitted from a variety of anthropogenic (human-influenced) and natural sources. In the  

  USA, methane accounted for 11% of greenhouse gas emissions in 2020. Agriculture accounts for  

  48% of the total methane emissions – larger than natural gas and petroleum systems – see Figure 2.

  Methane emitted by livestock (enteric fermentation and manure) accounted for 25% of the non- 
  CO  total. Croplands accounted for 16% and over 5% related to rice cultivation.xvi  
      2 

  Methane emissions have continued to grow since 2015 so this is consistent with estimates that  
  livestock accounts for a third of global methane emissions.xvii  In the words of Jeremy Coller,  

  Chair of FAIRR investor network, “cows are the new coal”.xviii  

  While CO  has been front and centre of climate discussion and policy measures, governments 2 

  have only recently woken up to methane. It wasn’t until COP26 in November 2021 that the Global  

  Methane Pledge was launched.  

  The countries that have signed the Pledge agreed to take voluntary actions to contribute to a  

  collective effort to reduce global methane emissions by at least 30 percent from 2020 levels by  

  2030, which could eliminate over 0.2ºC warming by 2050. In November 2022, at COP27, the US  

  and EU announced the launch of the ‘GMP Food and Agriculture Pathway’ which includes a focus  
  on reducing agri-methane emissions supported by a variety of new initiatives.xix  

  At the moment there is little sign that financial institutions are following the lead set by their host  

  countries. None of the financial institutions covered in this report has a policy that specifically  

  covers methane emissions from livestock.

      THE METHANE FOOTPRINT OF   
      15 MEAT & DAIRY COMPANIES  

        The Changing Markets Foundation (CMF) and the Institute for Agriculture  
         and Trade Policy (IATP) have calculated the GhG and methane-specific  
Temissions for a geographically diverse sample of five meat and 10 dairy  
companies using the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)’s Global  

                                                                                viii 
Livestock Environmental Assessment Model (GLEAM). 

The GhG emissions for each company were calculated by combining regional production  

estimates with regional average GhG emissions intensity data for meat (cattle, pigs and chickens)  

and milk production from GLEAM 2.0.  

                                                                                                       8 
Figure 3 depicts the ‘absolute’ estimated methane emissions of the 15 companies . 

      Figure 3: Methane emissions (tonnes) of 15 companies – 5 meat and 10 dairy. Source: CMF and IATP.xx 

The significant divergence in levels for two of the meat companies, Danish Crown and WH  

Group, can be explained by their focus on pigs, which produce less methane per kilo of food  

                        xxi 
product than beef.         In contrast, the three largest methane emitters, JBS, Marfrig and Tyson,  

are predominantly cattle-based, which (unlike pigs) generate large quantities of methane from  

enteric fermentation as well as manure.  

The GLEAM emissions factors are disaggregated by emissions source and by GhG, allowing  

emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide to be estimated and expressed in terms  

of tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO e) emissions.2 

8 Nestlé’s methane emissions were only calculated for their dairy business due to limited disclosures and so may not capture all 

their methane emissions but we believe their meat inputs are not material when compared to other companies in this list. Because 
 we are comparing the companies to each other, we have not converted their methane emissions into CO  equivalent units. 
                                                                                                     2 

                                                             12

Methane emissions mean that the overall GhG impact (on a GWP100 basis ) of the 15 meat  

and dairy companies is greater than that of oil majors like PetroChina and ExxonMobil and  

major countries like Germany. 

As shown in Figure 4, the GhG impact of the largest emitter, Brazil’s JBS, is more than half that  

of oil major BP or the country GhG emissions of Australia, and exceeds the GhG emissions of oil  

majors such as Occidental and Conoco Philips.

8 GWP (Global Warming Potential) is a measure of how much energy the emissions of one ton of a gas will absorb over a given  

period of time, relative to the emissions of one ton of carbon dioxide (CO ). The larger the GWP, the more that a given gas warms  
                                                                          2 
the Earth compared to CO  over that time period. The time period usually used for GWPs (particularly for comparing countries) is  
                           2 
100 years, however we have used 20 years for most of our analysis since this more closely matches the period to 2050 and thus  
the period over which companies and financial institutions need to achieve the required change. 

                                                                 13

As shown in Table 1, methane emissions of the 15 companies are estimated to be 345 Mt CO e 2 

per annum (GWP100) and around 1.0 Gt on the higher GWP20 basis. On the more relevant  

GWP20 measure, methane on average accounts for 72% of the GhG footprint (1.4 Gt CO e) for 2 

the 15 companies.

A number of asset managers rank higher in terms of their investments in the meat and dairy  

companies when compared to their size vs. their peers, implying they are more exposed.  We  

discuss this in the following section. 

                                                               15

Equity  

Seven of the 15 meat and dairy companies are private, often with co-operative/farmer linked  

ownership structures. One of these, Fonterra, does however have a fund structure which is listed  

and allows the public to invest. The remaining eight are publicly listed entities. All are widely held  

with over half the FI’s owning all eight. Unsurprisingly, 19 of the 20 FIs own Nestlé and Danone.  

Possibly more surprising, 13 of the 20 own JBS, the largest methane emitter by some margin –

On a combined basis the top 20 FIs have USD 115 billion invested in the nine listed companies.  

USD 10 billion of this is in the four meat companies and USD 105 billion in the five dairy  

companies. This represents 23% and 28% respectively of the total market capitalisation of each  

sub-sector, a material level – see Figure 5.

We have excluded two types of equity investor  

When compiling our list of top equity owners we have omitted two types of entities.  

•  Financial holding companies of founders/owners since we do not regard these as external  

   funders. This includes J&F Investimentos SA (JBS) and Jolina Capital Inc (Saputo). 

•  Sovereign Wealth Funds (SWFs). This includes the Federal Republic of Brazil (JBS and Marfrig)  

   and the Kingdom of Norway (USD 11 billion invested in six of the nine listed companies). SWFs  

   are discussed in more detail in the following section.

Equity investors with high exposure  

In broad terms we would expect the ranking in Table 4 to align with the quantity of assets under  
management (AuM)for each institution. However, there are a number of equity investors that   

are overweight in the meat and dairy companies versus the market when based on their AuM10.  

These are identified as ‘Over’ in Table 4 above. 

                                                                                          xxiv 
In particular, the following asset managers rank outside the top 50 globally                 in terms of their  

AuM but feature in our top 20 equity holders: Zürcher Kantonalbank (Asset Management),  

Hohhot Investment Company Ltd., Artisan Partners Asset Management Inc., Pictet & Group  

SCA Cie and First Eagle Holdings Inc. 

Fidelity, State Street, Crédit Agricole and JP Morgan Asset Management all hold smaller  

aggregate stakes in the meat and dairy companies than would be expected simply based on  

their ranking by AuM implying that their exposure is below their peers in relative terms. 

Sovereign wealth funds  

While we have omitted SWFs from our top 20 list, we believe that they deserve to be held  

accountable on the same basis. 

•  The Federal Republic of Brazil (FRoB) has USD 3.6 billion invested in meat companies; nearly  

   all in JBS (USD 3.6 billion) which is the highest methane emitter per dollar of ‘capital’ (enterprise  

   value). This gives FRoB an estimated GWP20 methane footprint of 50 Mt CO e – a colossal level, 2 

   equivalent to the combined methane footprint of the top five FIs combined. 

•  The Norwegian sovereign wealth fund, managed by Norges Bank Investment Management  

   (NBIM) has USD 11 billion invested; nearly all in dairy companies and predominantly in Nestlé  

   (USD 10 billion). Nestlé has a much lower methane footprint per dollar of capital as a result  

   of its very broad portfolio of business activities, resulting in NBIM having a lower portfolio  

   methane footprint of 1.9 Mt. If Norway’s SWF was included in the top 20 list it would rank ninth  

   in terms of methane footprint; just behind T Rowe Price at 2.0 Mt. 

The Norwegian SWF’s previous comments and actions on hydrocarbon investments have been  

widely noted. That said, neither The Federal Republic of Brazil nor the Norwegian SWF have  

a publicly available policy in place to address methane linked investments and in particular  

methane emissions from livestock. This is disappointing given that both Norway and Brazil have  

signed the Global Methane Pledge, and we would urge these SWFs to adopt methane policies  

aligned with the commitment. 

Bonds 

Poor disclosures may result in bond financing appearing to be much less prevalent in the meat  

and dairy space, both in terms of number of issuers (one meat and five dairy companies) and  

absolute amount. As shown in Table 5 the holdings of the top 20 holders amount to a combined  

total of USD 3.4 billion, with just two companies – Tyson and Danone – accounting for USD 2.9  

billion of this (86% of the total).  

10 ‘Overweight’ meaning they have more invested in meat and dairy companies than their peers relative to the size of their  

investment funds (smaller fund managers would not normally be expected to appear in the top 20 shareholders lists because  
they have less to invest). 

                                                          19 

----------------------- Page 20-----------------------

However, as noted previously, identifying bond holdings is made challenging by a lack of  

disclosure so these figures are likely to materially understate the actual level of funding being  

provided by bond investors, and the apparent high ranking of Tyson and Danone is more likely  

due to poor disclosures relating to the other companies rather than a true reflection of their  

ranking from a bond funding perspective. 

The impression that bond holdings are under-reported is corroborated by the much higher levels  

of debt disclosed by the various companies. This is discussed in the context of the bank loans we  

have identified later in this report. 

Thirteen of the top 20 equity owners are also bond holders. Six of these – Vanguard, Blackrock,  

Wellington, Credit Suisse, UBS and Crédit Agricole – are top 20 bond holders. However, relative to  

equity, the top 20 bond holders’ investments that can be identified are worth less than 3% of the  

equity amount - see Table 5.

Banks  

The (Brazilian) meat companies – high methane emitters – rely more heavily on debt funding. For  

JBS and Marfrig non-equity (debt and other) funding accounts for 62% and 91% respectively of  
their enterprise value11. For the dairy companies the average is nearer 30% – see Figure 6. 

   Figure 6: Enterprise value: Equity and non-equity mix. Source: Company accounts/Planet Tracker analysis. 

Note: Dairy Farmers of America, Lactalis and DMK do not publish financials – numbers for these companies are based on the average of the six  
other dairy companies – 72% equity and 28% non-equity. 

Analysis of the banks arranging financing (see Figure 7) shows a number of features also  

present in the equity space:  

•  Global participation: US, French, UK, Canadian, Swiss, Dutch and Japanese banks. 
•  Blue-chip names: for example, JP Morgan Chase (JPM), BNP Paribas and HSBC. 
•  Concentrated presence: the top five by USD account for nearly half of the top 20. 
•  Multi-company participation: JPM and HSBC are banks to eight of the 15 companies. 
•  Concentrated relationships: 15 of the top 20 finance Nestlé and 13 finance WH Group. 
•  A bias towards the dairy companies: 79% of financing aimed at these. 

11 ‘Enterprise value’ is a measure of a company’s capital – in simple terms it is the combination of the company’s equity and its net  

debt (total debt less cash).

Geographic bias: US meat backers and French dairy  

On a geographic basis the American banks, which includes JPM (#1) and Morgan Stanley (#2),  

are the biggest banks as shown in Figure 8. Also noteworthy is their participation in funding the  

‘methane heavy’ meat space: JPM finances all four of the listed meat companies, while Morgan  

Stanley and Bank of America finance three. Morgan Stanley is the only one of the top 20 investors  

to finance just meat companies. 

French banks are also very active in the space. Of the top eight banks, four are French: BNP  

Paribas, Société Générale, Crédit Agricole and Natixis – see Figure 8. Their focus is more on the  
dairy names, particularly the French companies of Lactalis and Danone. It is however noteworthy  

that three of the four help finance WH Foods, a Chinese pork company. 

                                                               22

Compensating for the lack of loan data  

Our data is based on publicly available records of financing arrangements (e.g. debt syndication  

and equity and note issuance/underwriting activity) over a period of ten years. In the main, banks  

are earning fees from facilitation, although in some instances they may also be investing capital.  

Our analysis of the global food system suggests an average debt capital cycle of two and a half  

years. Applying this to our 10 year total of USD 400 billion – see Table 6 – implies an average ‘live’  

financing amount of USD 100 billion. 

Unfortunately, information on a lot of debt-linked funding isn’t made public. Debt issued  

or traded on the public markets can be identified, but privately originated or negotiated  

investments are not traded on the public markets and are therefore not traceable. The net result  

is an incomplete dataset. The cumulative balance sheet debt of the nine companies that report  

figures is USD 116 billion. This is above our calculated amount of USD 100 billion, highlighting the  

extent to which market reporting of financing transactions understates the aggregate reality.  

More telling, however, is the lack of debt information in our dataset for the Brazilian meat  

companies. Reported balance sheet debt for JBS is USD 18.1 billion compared to our dataset   

10-year cumulative financing amount of USD 1.4 billion (8%).  

The lack of information regarding debt finance means that our estimate of the methane  

footprint attributable to the banks funding the meat and dairy companies is likely to significantly  

understate the extent of that footprint.

     ATTRIBUTING A METHANE FOOTPRINT  
     TO INVESTORS 

     he 15 meat and dairy companies have a combined annual GWP20 methane  
Tfootprint of 1,033 Mt CO e – one gigatonne. 2 

Company – methane per dollar of capital (CH /EV) 4 

Our starting point is the amount of methane per dollar of capital (equity and debt) for each of the  

meat and dairy companies – see Figure 9. 

             Figure 9: Methane (GWP20 CO e) to enterprise value (kg/USD). Source: Planet Tracker.2 

Note: No financial information available for Lactalis, DMK or Dairy Farmers of America, so no CH /EV.4 

The methane footprint is calculated using the 20-year Global Warming Potential method (GWP20)  

amount as estimated by CMF and the IATP. 

We divide this figure by the company’s capital (enterprise value) – the combination of equity  

capital (at market valuation for the publicly listed companies and at book value for private ones)  

and non-equity capital (principally debt net of cash) – to derive our CH /EV ratio. 
                                                                               4 

This ratio can then be multiplied by the value of the funding provided by an institution to a  

particular company to derive a funded methane footprint. That, in turn, can be aggregated with  

the funded footprints from other companies to derive a portfolio footprint. 

The key numbers are summarised in Table 7.

Note: For Danish Crown, Arla and Friesland Campina, balance sheet equity has been used instead of market cap. For Dairy Farmers of America, Lactilis  
and DMK, dairy sector average equity/non-equity split has been applied. Meat and dairy companies are shaded differently. See later note regarding DFA  
and Lactalis with respect to bank financing – we have assumed a methane per dollar of enterprise value of 3.9 (kg/USD) for both. This is based on the  
average of five other dairy companies: Fonterra, Yili, Saputo, Arla and Friesland Campina. 

Investor methane footprint of invested capital  

We have applied the company level CH /EV (kg / USD) amounts to the investments (USD of equity 4 

and bonds) held by each financial institution (FI) to arrive at portfolio totals for each investor, or,  

put another way, how much methane each financial institution is funding – see Figure 10.

On this basis, our 20 FIs ‘support’ a combined 68.1 Mt CO e of methane emissions. The majority 2 

(93%) of this, as illustrated in Figure 10, is attributable to their equity holdings. This represents  

14% of the estimated total equity-linked emissions.  

In a country context this places our top 20 investor methane CO e footprint above the CO  2                   2 
footprint of Austria (65 Mt) and close to Morocco (CO  emissions of 71.5 Mt in 2019).xxv 
                                                                 2 

The top three institutions, Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street, account for 62% of the total  

holdings on an attributable methane footprint basis across all 15 companies. All three are  

significant passive (index) fund investors, which means that the companies they invest in are  

determined by the indices their funds track, potentially restricting their ability to mitigate their  

methane footprint through their investment decisions. However, they have significant influence  

over the companies they support in terms of voting and can use this to encourage business  

practices that reduce their methane footprints. 

Fidelity (via FMR), which has investments in all four of the listed meat companies, is the largest  

investor amongst the predominantly active investor names. 

While JBS is the largest methane emitter – both in absolute terms (382 Mt CO e GWP20) and per 2 

dollar of enterprise value (13.8 kg per USD) – the top 20 investors have a total of just USD 0.6  

billion invested in the company.  

In contrast, 18 of the 20 invest in Tyson with a total combined investment amount of USD 10.9  

billion. While Tyson’s methane emission level per dollar of enterprise value (4 kg per USD) is  

about a quarter that of JBS, the sheer amount invested in the company by the top 20 (18x more  

than in JBS) results in it being the largest contributor to our top 20 investors’ footprint – see

      METHANE FOOTPRINT FUNDED BY BANKS 

Summary 

   n a similar manner to our investor footprint working, we have applied the  
   company level CH /EV amounts to our data on the amount of financing provided 4 
Iby the top 20 banks. 

On a combined basis the top 20 banks have a methane footprint linked to their financing  

activities in our 15 meat and dairy companies of 202.5 Mt – see Table 9. This is higher than the  
annual CO  emissions of countries like the Netherlands (146 Mt) and Argentina (168 Mt).xxvi This  
            2 

is also roughly three times the footprint of the top 20 investors. As discussed previously, the  

American and French banks dominate the lending and so together account for 66% of the top 20  

banks’ methane footprint. 

We have also calculated a ‘equal responsibility’ methane footprint which allocates the non-equity  

methane footprint equally amongst the banks. Using this approach we estimate the top 20 banks  
have a combined methane footprint linked to their support of the 15 meat and dairy companies  
of 435 Mt; above the 2019 CO  emission levels of Brazil and South Africa.xxvii  
                                  2 

Methane per dollar of capital (CH /EV – kg/USD) 4 

The starting point is the same as our investor footprint calculations: namely methane per dollar  

of enterprise value (capital) which was shown earlier in Table 7. 

We have had to make an educated guess as to the methane per dollar of enterprise value for two  

private companies – Dairy Farmers of America and Lactalis. Both appear on our bank financing  

database, but neither publishes financials. For this exercise we have assumed a methane per  

dollar of enterprise value of 3.9 (kg/USD) for both. This is based on the average of five other dairy  

companies: Fonterra, Yili, Saputo, Arla and Friesland Campina. 

Banks – methane footprint 

The two large American banks – Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan – with their wide exposure to  

meat funding, and in particular Tyson Foods, dominate. Combined they have a methane footprint  
of 71 Mt, equivalent to 35% of the top 20 total. Four French banks occupy spots four to seven:  

Société Générale, Crédit Agricole, BNP Paribas and Natixis. This primarily links to their financing  

of French dairy company Lactalis. Combined they have a methane footprint of 62 Mt, equivalent  

to 31% of the top 20 total – see Figure 12.

The bank financing totals aggregate lending over a period of ten years (Table 6), so we have  

estimated the current funding levels (i.e. the current outstanding bank loan balances) by dividing  

these amounts by four. This reflects our analysis of 400,000 food system companies across the  

globe that suggests that companies in the food space have a typical re-financing cycle of around  

two and a half years.  

As previously noted, due to lack of publicly available information on loans, our figures represent  
an incomplete and likely understated amount of financing which in turn means that the methane  

footprint of each bank will also be understated. Table 9 summarises our estimates.

Equal responsibility – a harsher measure of a bank’s methane  
footprint  

As noted above, poor lending data means that our estimate of the methane footprint of  

individual banks is likely to be significantly understated. 

An alternative approach is to argue that a company cannot undertake debt-funded projects  

unless all the banks in the syndicate agree to contribute, implying that if one bank withdrew then  

the project would not go ahead (or, at least, would cost more and thus be less likely to proceed).  

If one takes this approach, then it is fair to attribute ‘equal responsibility’ (and the associated  

share of the company’s methane footprint) based simply on a bank having a lending relationship  

with a company rather than analysing the extent of that relationship. This also has the effect of  

attributing the whole of the non-equity portion of the company’s methane footprint to the banks  
we have identified as funding the company12 (in contrast to the funding-based approach which  

leaves a portion of the methane footprint unallocated). 

The workings for this approach and a list of all the methane footprints for the banks concerned is  

set out in an appendix on page 44. 

The outcome is a much more extensive methane footprint for the banks and a change in the  

pecking order: JP Morgan Chase, with financing links to all the heavier emitting meat companies  

takes over the top spot with a methane footprint of 68 Mt CO e. 2 

Other American banks, including Bank of America (#7) and Morgan Stanley (#8), still feature  

heavily, but the French banks slip down the pecking order and are replaced by Banco Santander  

(#2) the Brazilian banks (Banco BTG Pactual, Banco Bradesco and Banco do Brasil – #3, #4, and  

#5 respectively). 

Where there is a banking relationship, the average footprint is 3 Mt CO e of methane. The total 2 

footprint of the banks surveyed is 497 Mt, with the top 20 accounting for 88%. Their footprint of 435  

Mt CO e is more than double the figure estimated using the funded basis (203 Mt – see Table 9).2 

435 Mt of methane emissions as calculated on an equal responsibility basis would place the  

combined top 20 banks well above countries such as the UK and Australia, and alongside Brazil  
and South Africa when compared to their CO  footprints.xxviii
